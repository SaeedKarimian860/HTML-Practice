    <h2>'Twice a week the winter thorough'</h2>
    <p>
      Twice a week the winter thorough <br />
      Here stood I to keep the goal: <br />
      Football then was fighting sorrow <br />
      For the young man’s soul. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in Maytime to the wicket <br />
      Out I march with bat and pad: <br />
      See the son of grief at cricket <br />
      Trying to be glad. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Try I will; no harm in trying: <br />
      Wonder ’tis how little mirth <br />
      Keeps the bones of man from lying <br />
      On the bed of earth. <br />

      The <b>Premier League</b> is a professional association football league in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</a> and the
      highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20
      clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the
      English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May,
      with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home
      and one away.<sup>[1]</sup> Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with
      occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2]

      The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992,
      following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888
      until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However,
      teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship.
      The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with
      member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage
      of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the
      domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This
      deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6]
      The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from
      2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4
      billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to
      EFL clubs.[8]
